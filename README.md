# data-science-webscraping
A project that scrapes information on the internet about data science programs and their curricula.

STEP ONE: Scraping this website (https://analytics.ncsu.edu/?page_id=4184) to get the list of degree programs, what degree they give, where the degree is hosted (school), and the website for each program.
